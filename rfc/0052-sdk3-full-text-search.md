# Summary

This RFC is part of the bigger SDK 3.0 RFC and describes the FTS APIs in detail.

# Technical Details

## API Entry Point

The full text search API is located at Cluster level:

```
interface ICluster {
    ...
    SearchResult SearchQuery(string indexName, SearchQuery query, [SearchOptions options]);
    ...
}
```

## ICluster::SearchQuery

Executes a Search or FTS query against the remote cluster and returns a ISearchResult implementation with the results of the query.

### Signature

```
SearchResult SearchQuery(string indexName, SearchQuery query, [SearchOptions options]);
```

### Parameters

* Required

    * `indexName` (`string`)

      the name of the search index to query

    * `query`  (`SearchQuery`)

      the instance of class implementing `SearchQuery` interface. See ["SearchQuery Implementations"](#searchquery-implementations) section
      below for more details.

* Optional (part of `SearchOptions`):

    * `limit` (`uint32`) = undefined (`10`). JSON path: `size`

      The `limit` option limits the number of matches returned from the complete result set. The actual HTTP query field is called `size`,
      but to match it with N1QL and Views it makes sense to name it similarly (also aliased to `limit` on server side since MadHatter (6.5),
      see [MB-32666](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32666)).

    * `skip` (`uint32`) = undefined (`0`). JSON path: `from`

      The `skip` option indicates how many matches are skipped on the result set before starting to return the matches. The actual HTTP
      query field is called `from`, but to match it with N1QL and Views it makes sense to name it similarly (also aliased to `offset` on
      server side since MadHatter (6.5), see [MB-32666](https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32666)).

    * `explain` (`bool`) = `false`. JSON path: `explain`

      The boolean `explain` field triggers inclusion of additional search result score explanations.

    * `highlight` (`Optional<HighlightStyle> style, Optional<string[]> fields`) = undefined (unset). JSON path: `highlight`

          enum HighlightStyle {
              HTML("html"),
              ANSI("ansi")
          }

       The `HighlightStyle` is an enumeration (or similar with a fixed set of possible values) which describes the highlighters the Server
       supports. Both `style` and `field` are optional. If no `field` is provided FTS will just highlight all fields where there is a
       match. Some languages might need to support a `null` style for the combination where no style is requested, but specific fields
       are. When none style, nor fields specified, the server will highlight all fields using default style.

    * `fields` (`string[]`) = undefined (unset). JSON path: `fields`

      This option describes a list of field values which should be retrieved for result documents, provided they were stored while indexing.

    * `scanConsistency` (`SearchScanConsistency`) = undefined (`NotBounded`). JSON path: `ctl.consistency.level`

          enum SearchScanConsistency {
              NotBounded("")
          }

       overrides `consistentWith`

    * `consistentWith` (`MutationState`) = undefined. JSON paths:
      * `ctl.consistency.level` = `"at_plus"`
      * `ctl.consistency.vectors`

        contains the consistency vector for each index (a JSON object keyed by FTS index name). A single vector is also a JSON object. The
        keys are in the `"vbucketId/vbucketUUID"` format (can be built from a `MutationToken`) and the values are `uint64` seqno sequence
        numbers.

    * `sort` (`string[]`) = undefined (`["-_score"]`). JSON path: `sort`

      The `_score` and `_id` fields are special since they allow to either sort on the document score or on the document ID. Also, if a
      field is prefixed with `"-"` the sorting order is descending.

    * `sort` (`SearchSort[]`) = undefined (undefined). JSON path: `sort`

      In addition to the simple string sort outlined above, an advanced sorting mechanism should be supported which allows the user to
      provide more detailed requirements on sorting that can't be expressed in a simple string. The method overrides variant with list of
      the fields. See possible implementations of `SearchSort` below

        * `SearchSortScore`. Sorts by hit score. JSON paths:
          * `by` = `"score"`
          * `desc` (`boolean`) = undefined (`false`)

        * `SearchSortId`. Sorts by the document ID. JSON paths:
          * `by` = `"id"`
          * `desc` (`boolean`) = undefined(`false`): if descending order should be applied

        * `SeachSortField`. Sorts by a field in the hits. JSON paths:
          * `by` =  `"field"`
          * `desc` (`boolean`) = undefined(`false`): if descending order should be applied
          * `field` (`string`): the name of the field to sort on
          * `type` (`string`) = undefined (`"auto"`): possible values are `"auto"`, `"string"`, `"number"`, `"date"`
          * `mode`  (`string`) = undefined (`"default"`): possible values are `"default"`, `"min"`, `"max"`
          * `missing` (`string`) = undefined (`"last"`): possible values are `"first"`, `"last"`

        * `SearchSortGeoDistance`. Sorts by geographic location distance in the hits. JSON paths:
          * `by` = `"geo_distance"`
          * `desc` (`boolean`) = undefined(`false`): if descending order should be applied
          * `field` (`string`): the name of the field to sort on
          * `location` (`float32[2]`): similar to geo querying: `[lon, lat]`
          * `unit` (`string`) = undefined (`Meters`): the unit multiplier which should be used for sorting. Default multiplier is
            `Meters`. Acceptable values.

                enum SearchGeoDistanceUnits {
                    Meters("meters"),
                    Miles("miles"),
                    Centimeters("centimeters"),
                    Millimeters("millimeters"),
                    NauticalMiles("nauticalmiles"),
                    Kilometers("kilometers"),
                    Feet("feet"),
                    Yards("yards"),
                    Inch("inch")
                }


    * `facets` (`Map<string name, SearchFacet facet>`) = undefined (undefined). JSON path: `facets`

      Facets allow to aggregate information collected on a particular result set.

        * `TermFacet`. Gives number of occurrences of the most recurring terms in all rows. JSON paths:
          * `field` (`string`): required name of the field
          * `size` (`uint32`) = undefined: optional number of facets/categories returned

        * `NumericRangeFacet`. Categorizes rows into numerical ranges (or buckets). JSON paths:
          * `field` (`string`): required name of the field
          * `size` (`uint32`) = undefined: optional number of facets/categories returned
          * `numeric_ranges` (`array`): non empty list of the ranges defined as following. The SDK might expose it as single function with
            three arguments, or define class NumericRange that will encapsulate single range, and then pass it to the builder.
            * `name` (`string`): required name of the range
            * `min` (`float` or `uint32`) = undefined: optional lower bound of the range
            * `max` (`float` or `uint32`) = undefined: optional upper bound of the range

        * `DateRangeFacet`. Categorizes rows inside date ranges (or buckets). JSON paths:
          * `field` (`string`): required name of the field
          * `size` (`uint32`) = undefined: optional number of facets/categories returned
          * `date_ranges` (`array`): non empty list of the ranges defined as following
            * `name` (`string`): required name of the range
            * `start` (`Date`): (encoded as a string to be parsed by golang on the server side) = undefined: optional lower bound of the
              range
            * `end` (`string`) = undefined: optional upper bound of the range

    * `timeout` (`Duration`) = `$Cluster::searchOperationTimeout`. JSON path: `ctl.timeout`

      Specifies how long to allow the operation to continue running before it is cancelled (default value defined in
      [0059-sdk3-foundation](0059-sdk3-foundation.md)). Also sets server-side timeout in milliseconds.

    * `serializer` (`JsonSerializer`) = `$Cluster::Serializer`.

      Specifies the serializer which should be used for deserialization of the fields member which is read from the
      `SearchRow`. `JsonSerializer` interface is defined in
      [0055-sdk3-transcoders-and-serializers](0055-sdk3-transcoders-and-serializers.md).

    * `raw` (`string key, string value`)

      This is an escape hatch to support unknown commands and be forward compatible in future.

    * `includeLocations` (`bool`) = `false`. JSON path: `includeLocations`

      The boolean `includeLocations` field triggers inclusion of search row locations.

## SearchQuery implementations

### MatchQuery


A match query analyzes the input text and uses that analyzed text to query the index. An attempt is made to use the same analyzer that was
used when the field was indexed.

JSON paths:
* `match` (`string`): the input string to be matched against. The match string is required.

* `field` (`string`) = undefined: if a field is specified, only terms in that field will be matched. This can also affect the used analyzer
  if one isn't specified explicitly.

* `analyzer` (`string`) = undefined: analyzers are used to transform input text into a stream of tokens for indexing. The Server comes with
  built-in analyzers and the users can create their own. The string here is the name of the analyzer used.

* `prefix_length` (`uint32`) = undefined: require that the term also have the same prefix of the specified length (must be positive).

* `fuzziness` (`uint32`) = undefined: perform fuzzy matching. If the fuzziness parameter is set to a non-zero integer the analyzed text will
  be matched with the specified level of fuzziness.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

* `operator` (`MatchOperator`) = undefined: Defines how the individual match terms should be logically concatenated.
    * `MatchOperator` is an enum containing
      * OR (json:`"or"`) = undefined. Individual match terms are concatenated with a logical OR - this is the default if not provided.
      * AND (json: `"and"`) = undefined. Individual match terms are concatenated with a logical AND.
### MatchPhraseQuery

The input text is analyzed and a phrase query is built with the terms resulting from the analysis. This type of query searches for terms
occurring in the specified positions and offsets. This depends on term vectors, which are consulted to determine phrase distance.

JSON paths:
* `match_phrase` (`string`): the input phrase to be matched against. The match phrase string is required.

* `field` (`string`) = undefined: if a field is specified, only terms in that field will be matched. This can also affect the used analyzer
  if one isn't specified explicitly.

* `analyzer` (`string`) = undefined: analyzers are used to transform input text into a stream of tokens for indexing. The Server comes with
  built-in analyzers and the users can create their own. The string here is the name of the analyzer used.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### RegexpQuery

Finds documents containing terms that match the specified regular expression.

JSON paths:
* `regexp` (`string`): the regular expression to be analyzed and used. The regexp string is required.

* `field` (`string`) = undefined: if a field is specified, only terms in that field will be matched.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### QueryStringQuery

The query string query allows humans to describe complex queries using a simple syntax.

JSON paths:
* `query` (`string`): The query string to be analyzed and used against. The query string is required.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### WildcardQuery

A wildcard query is a query in which term the character `*` will match `0..n` occurrences of any characters and `?` will match `1`
occurrence of any character.

JSON paths:
* `wildcard` (`string`): the wildcard-containing term to be analyzed and searched. The wildcard string is required.

* `field` (`string`) = undefined: if a field is specified, only terms in that field will be matched.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### DocIdQuery

A docId query is a query that directly matches the documents whose ID have been provided. It can be combined within a `ConjunctionQuery` to
restrict matches on the set of documents.

JSON paths:
* `ids` (`array<string>`): The list of document IDs to be restricted against. At least one ID is required at execution time, but a
  `DocIdQuery` should be constructible without one to allow progressive programmatic population of the ID list.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### BooleanFieldQuery

Allow to match `true`/`false` in a field mapped as boolean.

JSON paths:
* `bool` (`true` or `false`): The boolean value to be looked for, required.

* `field` (`string`) = undefined: if a field is specified, only terms in that field will be matched. It should generally be encouraged to use the field, which must be a boolean field.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### DateRangeQuery

The date range query finds documents containing a date value in the specified field within the specified range. Either start or end can be
omitted, but not both.

JSON paths:
* `start` (`string`) = unset (unset): The lower end of the range.

* `inclusive_start` (`bool`) = unset (`true`): whether to include lower end of the range.

* `end` (`string`) = unset (unset): The higher end of the range.

* `inclusive_end` (`bool`) = unset (`true`): whether to include higher end of the range.

* `datetime_parser` (`string`) = unset: enable customer date time parser.

* `field` (`string`) = undefined: if a field is specified, only terms in that field will be matched.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).


### NumericRangeQuery

The numeric range query finds documents containing a numeric value in the specified field within the specified range. Either min or max can
be omitted, but not both.

JSON paths:
* `min` (`float` or `uint32`) = unset (unset): The lower end of the range.

* `inclusive_min` (`bool`) = unset (`true`): whether to include lower end of the range.

* `max` (`float` or `uint32`) = unset (unset): The higher end of the range.

* `inclusive_max` (`bool`) = unset (`true`): whether to include higher end of the range.

* `field` (`string`) = undefined: if a field is specified, only terms in that field will be matched.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### TermRangeQuery

The term range query finds documents containing a string value in the specified field within the specified range. Either min or max can be
omitted, but not both.

JSON paths:
* `min` (`string`) = unset (unset): The lower end of the range.

* `inclusive_min` (`bool`) = unset (`true`): whether to include lower end of the range.

* `max` (`string`) = unset (unset): The higher end of the range.

* `inclusive_max` (`bool`) = unset (`true`): whether to include higher end of the range.

* `field` (`string`) = undefined: if a field is specified, only terms in that field will be matched.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### GeoDistanceQuery

This query finds all matches from a given location (`geopoint`) within the given distance. Both the point and the distance are required.

JSON paths:
* `location` (`float32[2]`): The location represents a point from which the distance is measured.

  The server accepts many formats for geo points, but the most terse one that should be used is as a JSON array where the first element is
  the longitude and the second element the latitude both encoded as JSON numbers:

      {"location": [lon, lat]}

* `distance` (`string`): The distance describes how far from the location the radius should be matched. For example, `"11km"`,
  `"11kilometers"`, `"3nm"`, `"3nauticalmiles"`, `"17mi"`, `"17miles"`, `"19m"`, `"19meters"`.

* `field` (`string`) = undefined: if a field is specified, only terms in that field will be matched.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### GeoBoundingBoxQuery

This query finds all `geopoint` indexed matches within a given box (identified by the upper left and lower right corner coordinates). Both
coordinate points are required so the server can identify the right bounding box.

JSON paths:
* `top_left` (`float32[2]`): The top left coordinates signify the bounding box area and are required (`[lon, lat]`).

* `bottom_right` (`float32[2]`): The bottom right coordinates signify the bounding box area and are required (`[lon, lat]`).

* `field` (`string`) = undefined: if a field is specified, only terms in that field will be matched.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### ConjunctionQuery

The conjunction query is a compound query. The result documents must satisfy all of the child queries. It is possible to recursively nest
compound queries.

At execution, a conjunction query that has no child queries should fail fast (eg. throw an exception before a request is sent to the
server).

When idiomatic to the language, variable-length argument or lists of queries can also be accepted for each method (allowing to add several
queries to the "AND" in one go).

JSON paths:
* `conjuncts` (`array`) = undefined: list of the `SearchQuery` implementations.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### DisjunctionQuery

The disjunction query is a compound query. The result documents must satisfy a configurable minimal (`min`) number of child queries. By
default this `min` is set to 1.

At execution, a disjunction query that has fewer child queries than the configured minimum should fail fast (eg. throw an exception before a
request is sent to the server). Similarly, a disjunction query without child queries should also fail fast.

When idiomatic to the language, variable-length argument or lists of queries can also be accepted for each method (allowing to add several
queries to the "OR" in one go).

JSON paths:
* `disjuncts` (`array`) = undefined: list of the `SearchQuery` implementations.

* `min` (`uint32`) = 1: The minimum number of child queries that must be satisfied for the disjunction query.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### BooleanQuery

The boolean query is a useful combination of conjunction and disjunction queries. A boolean query takes three lists of queries:

* **must** - result documents must satisfy all of these queries.
* **should** - result documents should satisfy these queries.
* **must not** - result documents must not satisfy any of these queries.

At execution, a boolean query that has no child queries in any 3 categories should fail fast (eg. throw an exception before a request is
sent to the server).

The inner representation of child queries in the must/must_not/should sections are respectively a ConjunctionQuery and two DisjunctionQuery.

JSON paths:
* `must` (`ConjunctionQuery`) = undefined: a `ConjunctionQuery` object of the **must queries

* `should` (`DisjunctionQuery`) = undefined: a `DisjunctionQuery` object of the **should** queries

* `should.min` (`uint32`) = 1: If a hit satisfies at least `min` queries in the **should** section, its score will be boosted. By default,
  this is set to 1. This can be omitted if the underlying `DisjunctionQuery` is directly exposed and editable, or if a direct mean of
  setting the payload `should.min` is available (for instance in a language like Python).

* `must_not` (`DisjunctionQuery`) = undefined: a `DisjunctionQuery` object of the **must not** queries

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### TermQuery

A query that looks for **exact** matches of the term in the index (no analyzer, no stemming). Useful to check what the actual content of the
index is. It can also apply fuzziness on the term. Usual better alternative is `MatchQuery`.

JSON paths:
* `term` (`string`): The mandatory term is the exact string that will be searched into the index. Note that the index can (and usually will)
  contain terms that are derived from the text in documents, as analyzers can apply process like stemming. For example, indexing
  "programming" could store "program" in the index. As a term query doesn't apply the analyzers, one would need to look for "program" to
  have a match on that index entry.

* `field` (`string`) = undefined: if a field is specified, only terms in that field will be matched.

* `fuzziness` (`uint32`) = undefined: perform fuzzy matching. If the fuzziness parameter is set to a non-zero integer the analyzed text will
  be matched with the specified level of fuzziness.

* `prefix_length` (`uint32`) = undefined: require that the term also have the same prefix of the specified length (must be positive). The
  prefix length only makes sense when `fuzziness` is enabled (see above). It allows to apply the fuzziness only on the part of the term that
  is after the `prefix_length` character mark.

  For example, with the term "something" and a prefix length of 4, only the "thing" part of the term will be fuzzy-searched, and hits must
  start with "some".

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).


### PrefixQuery

The prefix query finds documents containing terms that start with the provided prefix. Usual better alternative is `MatchQuery`.

JSON paths:
* `prefix` (`string`): The prefix to be analyzed and used against. The prefix string is required.

* `field` (`string`) = undefined: if a field is specified, only terms in that field will be matched.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### PhraseQuery

A query that looks for **exact** match of several terms (in the exact order) in the index. The provided terms must exist in the correct
order, at the correct index offsets, in the specified field (as no analyzer are applied to the terms). Queried field must have been indexed
with inncludeTermVectors set to true. It is generally more useful in debugging scenarios, and the `MatchPhraseQuery` should usually be
preferred for real-world use cases.

JSON paths:
* `terms` (`array`): The mandatory list of terms that must exactly match in the index. Note that the index can (and usually will) contain
  terms that are derived from the text in documents, as analyzers can apply process like stemming. Array size > 1, entries must not be
  empty.

  For example, indexing "programming books" could store "program" and "book" in the index. As a phrase query doesn't apply the analyzers,
  one would need to look for "program book" to have a match on that indexed document.

* `field` (`string`) = undefined: if a field is specified, only terms in that field will be matched.

* `boost` (`float`) = undefined. The boost parameter is used to increase the relative weight of a clause (with a boost greater than 1) or
  decrease the relative weight (with a boost between 0 and 1).

### MatchAllQuery

A query that matches all indexed documents.

JSON paths:
* `match_all` = `null`: The JSON representation of a `MatchAllQuery` is simply a `"match_all": null` entry in the query JSON Object.

### MatchNoneQuery

A query that matches nothing.

JSON paths:
* `match_none` = `null`: The JSON representation of a `MatchNoneQuery` is simply a `"match_none": null` entry in the query JSON Object.

## Return Types

### SearchResult

The `SearchResult` interface provides a means of mapping the results of a Search query into an object.

```
interface SearchResult {
    Stream<SearchRow> Rows();
    Map<String, SearchFacetResult> Facets();
    SearchMetaData MetaData();
}
```

### SearchRow

A single entry of search results. The server calls them "hits", and represents as a JSON object. The following interface describes the
contents of the result row.

```
interface SearchRow {
    String Index();
    String Id();
    double Score();
    JsonObject Explanation();
    Optional<SearchRowLocations> Locations();
    Optional<Map<String, String[]>> Fragments();
    Optional<T> Fields<T>();
}
```

### SearchRowLocations

```
interface SearchRowLocations {
    // list all locations (any field, any term)
    List<SearchRowLocation> GetAll();

    // list all locations for a given field (any term)
    List<SearchRowLocation> Get(String field);

    // list all locations for a given field and term
    List<SearchRowLocation> Get(String field, String term);

    // list the fields in this location
    List<String> Fields();

    // list all terms in this locations, considering all fields (so a set)
    Set<String> Terms();

    // list the terms for a given field
    List<String> TermsFor(String field);
}
```

### SearchRowLocation

```
interface SearchRowLocation {
    String Field();
    String Term();
    uint32 Position;
    uint32 Start;
    uint32 End;
    Optional<uint32[]> ArrayPositions();
}
```

### SearchFacetResult

An individual facet result has both metadata and details, as each facet can define ranges into which results are categorized.

```
interface SearchFacetResult {
    String Name();
    String Field();
    uint64 Total();
    uint64 Missing();
    uint64 Other();
}
```

### SearchMetaData

Represents the meta-data returned along with a search query result.


```
interface SearchMetaData {
    SearchMetrics Metrics();
    Map<String, String> Errors();
}
```

Sample request/response payloads: [sdk-testcases/search](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-testcases/tree/master/search)

If top-level `"error"` property exists, then SDK should build and throw `CouchbaseException` with its content.

### SearchMetrics

```
interface SearchMetrics {
    Duration Took();
    uint64 TotalRows();
    double MaxScore();
    uint64 TotalPartitionCount(); // SuccessPartitionCount + ErrorPartitionCount
    uint64 SuccessPartitionCount();
    uint64 ErrorPartitionCount();
}
```
