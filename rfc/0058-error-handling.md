* RFC Name: SDK Error Handling
* RFC ID: 58
* Start-Date: 2019-4-23
* Owners: Jeff Morris <jeffry.morris@couchbase.com>, Michael Nitschinger <michael.nitschinger@couchbase.com>
* Current Status: ACCEPTED

## Summary

Defines the error handling semantics of the SDK-3.0 and lists the exception or error classes that each SDK MUST implement.

## Motivation

* Consistent handling of errors or exceptions across all SDKs.
* Classifies and defines the specific error or exceptions generated by the SDK.
* Explains how specific errors should be handled by an application.

## General Design

Exceptions (errors) are broken into different classifications:

* Shared Exceptions - exceptions or errors thrown or returned by any service
* Specific Exceptions - exceptions or errors thrown by a service and specific to the service that threw or returned them.
* Internal Exceptions - exceptions intended to be handled internally by the SDK and not exposed to the application.

All exceptions derive from a common base Couchbase exception. Furthermore, exceptions can be either internal to the SDK, meaning that they should not be propagated to the application layer, or public and intended to allowed to bleed up to the application level.

The following diagram is a conceptual diagram showing the relationships and hierarchy of the exception/error model within the Couchbase SDKs:  

![figure 1: general design](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-rfcs/blob/master/rfc/figures/0058-general-design.png)

### Base Exception

The base exception should be a class, structure, or similar component which derives or implements the platform idiomatic class, structure or object representing and error or exception. The purpose is to readily distinguish an error handled and perhaps thrown by the SDK and a system or platform idiomatic error/exception. The name must be word “Couchbase” with either “Error” or “Exception” appended to it and derive from whatever system level generic exception or error is available. As always, idiomatic naming and casing should always apply to any SDK specific implementation.

Each CouchbaseException must have two properties:

* An ErrorContext
* An optional Cause

```Java
class CouchbaseException extends “PlatformException” {
  context: ErrorContext,
  cause: Optional<Exception>
}
```

The `ErrorContext` is a marker Interface which should be implemented for each service, but is implementation specific. The code must be able to serialize this into a JSON format and dump it next to the error/exception when logged. This is important to provide as much context as possible when debugging.

As a rough guideline, here are samples what the individual implementations could contain:

```Java
interface ErrorContext {
    lastDispatchedTo: Optional<String>,
    lastDispatchedFrom: Optional<String>,
    retryAttempts: int,
     retryReasons: Set<RetryReason>
}
```

Service specific context extends the generic Error context with the following attributes (if present):

* KeyValueErrorContext
  * Document Key
  * Opaque
  * KV Status Code
  * Bucket name
  * Collection name
  * Scope name
  * KV Error Map Info (if present)
    * Name
    * Desc
  * Extended Error Information (if present by server)
    * XError Ref
    * XError Context

* SubDocumentErrorContext
  * Extends KeyValueErrorContext fields
  * Adds “index” which describes the index of the error

* QueryErrorContext
  * Query Statement
  * ClientContextId
  * Query Parameters
  * Query Error Http Response Code
  * Query Error Response Body

* AnalyticsErrorContext
  * Query Statement
  * ClientContextId
  * Analytics Parameters
  * Analytics Error Http Response Code
  * Analytics Error Response Body

* ViewErrorContext
  * Design Document Name
  * View Name
  * View Query Params
  * View Error Http Response Code
  * View Error Response Body

* SearchErrorContext
  * Index Name
  * Search Query
  * Search Params
  * Search Error Http Response Code
  * Search Error Response Body

If the more specific error contexts above do not apply, it is recommended to fallback to a more generic http error context. As much information as possible (and makes sense) must be included:

* HTTPErrorContext
  * Method
  * Request Path
  * Response Code
  * Response Body

In addition each context might be able to peek into the additional information defined by the RTO RFC, so that it includes properties like: dispatch time, local socket and remote socket, encoding time, etc.

If an underlying exception has been the cause of the user facing one (this will heavily depend on the platform and actual error), it should be attached as the cause so that nested stack traces are visible in the logs.

### Shared Exceptions

A shared exception is common across all services and specific to known. Examples include:

* TemporaryFailureException
* TimeoutException
* RequestCancelledException
* Etc.

These may or may not be exceptions defined by the underlying platform. These are to be seen as on the same level as the service exceptions and draw directly from the `CouchbaseException`.

### Specific Exceptions (and Internal Exceptions)

Specific errors are always returned from Couchbase server itself and are specific to the service which generated them. Specific exceptions may also be Internal Exceptions, meaning that they are handled internally by the SDK and not propagated to the application.

Examples of specific exceptions:

* KeyNotFoundException
* NotMyVBucketException
* Etc.

The purpose of these errors is to allow for fine-tuned handling of them by either the SDK if they are intended to be an internal error or the application itself.

### Aggregate Exception/Error

In certain situations, like bootstrapping, where multiple exceptions might be thrown (one for each server in the bootstrap list until success is reached), an Aggregate Exception/Error may be returned/thrown.

![figure 2: Aggregate Exception](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-rfcs/blob/master/rfc/figures/0058-aggregate-exception.png)

Above is an example of the structure that a model of an AggregateException/Error may take, however, please defer to platform idiomatic design decisions when implementating.

Aggregate exceptions can be platform specific and may not be needed / necessary in every language. If possible, errors should be distilled down to one exception with potentially multiple nested causes to make it easier for the user to figure out what’s going on.

### User Surface Area

The user is only expected to catch/handle the “leaf” nodes of the exception hierarchy and the generic Couchbase exception. The service exception groups will only be raised if no specific exception can be identified (i.e. a too generic or unknown exception) - it is expected to bubble up through the CouchbaseException still in this case.

So in its most simplest form, because based on the retry rfc, we are retrying everything we can already a user is expected to write code like this:

```Java
try {
  some_couchbase_call();
} catch (CouchbaseException x) {
 // log and rethrow
}

If a user then needs to handle certain leaf exceptions directly, they can add additional clauses but still let the rest bubble up:

try {
  collection.get();
} catch (KeyNotFoundException x) {
 // handle a key not found separately
} catch (CouchbaseException x) {
 // log and rethrow
}
```

## Error Definitions

The next sections cover all the possible errors, but do not assign them to commands. Each command in a related RFC needs to refer to the exception type and ID thrown so that there are no “doubly linked lists” that easily get out of date.

Note that for brevity reasons the suffix “Exception” is not used when describing each definition.

A Note on IDs: The IDs in this RFC are only for organisational purposes and MUST NOT be surfaced to the user at this point. Future enhancements w.r.t permalinks from the SDKs can use these numbers as a baseline but additional research needs to be done.

### 0 CouchbaseException

* Inherits from System Exception/Error
* Parent Type for all exceptions below
* Shared Error Definitions (ID Range: 1-99)

### 1 Timeout

* Raised When
  * A request cannot be completed until the user-defined timeout fires
* Notes
  * This is a base class for #13 and #14 ! (Ambiguous and Unambiguous)

### 2 RequestCanceled

* Raised When
  * A request is cancelled and cannot be resolved in a non-ambiguous way. Most likely the request is in-flight on the socket and the socket gets closed.

### 3 InvalidArgument

* Raised When
  * It is unambiguously determined that the error was caused because of invalid arguments from the user
  * KV Subdoc:
    * 0xcb
  * Notes
    * Usually only thrown directly when doing request arg validation
    * Also commonly used as a parent class for many service-specific exceptions (see below)

### 4 ServiceNotAvailable

* Raised when
  * It can be determined from the config unambiguously that a given service is not available. I.e. no query node in the config, or a memcached bucket is accessed and views or n1ql
   queries should be performed

### 5 InternalServerFailure

* Raised When
  * Query: Error range 5xxx
  * Analytics: Error range 25xxx
  * KV: error code ERR_INTERNAL (0x84)

* Raised When
  * KV: 0x81 (unknown command), 0x83 (not supported)

### 13 AmbiguousTimeout

* Raised When
  * A timeout occurs and we aren’t sure if the underlying operation has completed.  This normally occurs because we sent the request to the server successfully, but timed out waiting for the response.  Note that idempotent operations should never return this, as they do not have ambiguity.

### 14 UnambiguousTimeout

* Raised When
  * A timeout occurs and we are confident that the operation could not have succeeded.  This normally would occur because we received confident failures from the server, or never managed to successfully dispatch the operation.

  * Search
    * Http status code 400 AND text contains “index not found”

### 18 IndexExists

* Query
  * Raised When
  * Note: the uppercase index for 5000 is not a mistake (also only match on exist not exists because there is a typo somewhere in query engine which might either print exist or exists depending on the codepath)
